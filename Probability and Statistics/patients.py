Title : In a particular pain clinic, 10% of patients are prescribed narcotic pain killers. Overall,
five percent of the clinicâ€™s patients are addicted to narcotics (including pain killers and illegal
substances). Out of all the people prescribed pain pills, 8% are addicts. If a patient is an addict,
write a program to find the probability that they will be prescribed pain pills?
